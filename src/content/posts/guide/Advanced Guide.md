This guide covers advanced customization options and features available in the Twilight template, from global configurations to specialized Markdown extensions.


## Global Configuration

The `twilight.config.yaml` file is the heart of your blog's configuration. Here are some advanced settings you can tweak:

### Site & Localization

- **Language & Translation**: Enable client-side translation using `site.translate.enable`. You can choose different services and configure auto-detection.

- **Custom Fonts**: Add your own fonts by providing a CSS link or file path under `site.font`.

### Visual Effects

- **Theme Color**: Change the primary color of your blog by adjusting the `site.themeColor.hue` (0-360).

- **Wallpaper Modes**: Choose between `banner`, `fullscreen`, or `none`. You can also enable a `carousel` for multiple wallpapers with the `kenBurns` effect.

- **Waves Effect**: Toggle the animated water ripple effect on the banner using `site.wallpaper.banner.waves.enable`.

- **Particle Effects**: Enable floating particles in the background with `particle.enable`.

### UI 

- **Navbar Transparency**: Adjust `site.wallpaper.banner.navbar.transparentMode` between `semi`, `full`, or `semifull`.

- **Sidebar Widgets**: Reorder or toggle sidebar components like `profile`, `announcement`, `categories`, `tags`, `toc`, and `statistics` in `sidebar.components`.


## Markdown Extensions
